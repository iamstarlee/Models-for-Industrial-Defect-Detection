This repo includes 5 ordinary models and 5 super-resolution models for classifying super-resolution dataset after downscaling

## 1. Datasets
**[MVTecAD](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Bergmann_MVTec_AD_--_A_Comprehensive_Real-World_Dataset_for_Unsupervised_Anomaly_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)** is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial inspection. It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and texture categories. Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects.

## 2. Metrics
We use the common metric: AUROC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve).

## 3. Experiment
Quantitative results of 10 challenging methods on MVTecAD
